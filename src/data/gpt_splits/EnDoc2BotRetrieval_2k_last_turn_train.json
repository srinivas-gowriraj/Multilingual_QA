No one can promise immediate and total loan forgiveness or cancellation.

They ask you to sign and submit a third - party authorization form or a power of attorney. These are written agreements giving the third party legal permission to talk directly to your federal loan servicer and make decisions on your behalf. Debt relief companies often want these authorizations so that they can change your account and contact information , so you don t realize that they aren t actually paying your monthly student loan bill. They claim that their offer is limited and encourage you to act immediately. Student loan debt relief companies often try to instill a sense of urgency by citing new laws or discontinuing programs as a way to encourage borrowers to contact them immediately.
