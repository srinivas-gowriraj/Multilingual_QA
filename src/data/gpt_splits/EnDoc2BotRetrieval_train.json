They ask you to sign and submit a third - party authorization form or a power of attorney.

Debt relief companies often want these authorizations so that they can change your account and contact information , so you don t realize that they aren t actually paying your monthly student loan bill. They claim that their offer is limited and encourage you to act immediately. Student loan debt relief companies often try to instill a sense of urgency by citing new laws or discontinuing programs as a way to encourage borrowers to contact them immediately.
