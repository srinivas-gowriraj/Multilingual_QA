They ask you to sign and submit a third - party authorization form or a power of attorney.

Debt relief companies often want these authorizations so that they can change your account and contact information , so you don t realize that they aren t actually paying your monthly student loan bill. They claim that their offer is limited and encourage you to act immediately. Student loan debt relief companies often try to instill a sense of urgency by citing new laws or discontinuing programs as a way to encourage borrowers to contact them immediately.

If you are using the myStudentAid app, you will need to select the option indicating that you d like to be considered for an unsubsidized loan. The application explains that if your parents don t support you and refuse to provide their information on the application, you may submit your FAFSA form without their information. However , you won t be able to get any federal student aid other than an unsubsidized loan and even that might not happen. The decision is up to the financial aid office at the college or career school you plan to attend. If you agree to this , you may submit your FAFSA form without parent information. Your FAFSA information will be sent to the colleges you list , but you won t get an EFC. You must immediately contact your school s financial aid office to discuss the possibility of getting an unsubsidized loan. The financial aid office may ask for a written statement from your parents, indicating that they refuse to provide their information on the FAFSA form and that they no longer support you. Forms of support include allowing you to live in their home, including you on their car or health insurance, providing a car to drive on a regular basis, and payment of your tuition or fees. The financial aid office will look at your situation and decide whether you may receive an unsubsidized loan. That decision is final and cannot be appealed to the U.S. Department of Education.\/\/What if my parents are unwilling to provide their information on my FAFSA form? \/\/Reporting Parent Information | Federal Student Aid "}
